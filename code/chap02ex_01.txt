If I were asked to summarize what I learned abouut whether first babies arrive late and I wanted to get a story on 
the evening news, I would use the mean of 38 weeks or the mode of 39 weeks (basically a measure of central tendency) 
since a timely pregnancy would be considered 36 weeks. 

If I wanted to reassure an anxious patient, I would use a measure of dispersion such as standard deviation or Cohen's D
because they give insight on common time intervals that pregnancies are late (and early) by.

Do first babies arrive late? I don't believe that first babies arrive late. First babies arrive on average after 38.6 
weeks of pregnancy and non-first babies arrive on average after 38.52 weeks of pregnancy. Not only do first babies
arrive earlier on average than their non-first counterparts, but the difference between the two groups are only around
0.08 weeks. Since the standard deviation is 2.7 weeks, the difference of means is only roughly 0.029
standard deviations. It appears that the difference of means between the two groups aren't even statistically
significant.
